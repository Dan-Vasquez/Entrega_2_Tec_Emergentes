#Vulnerabilidades que dice Remix:

This contract is generally well-structured and avoids major vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflows), but here are key risks to address:

##Front-Running Tax Changes:

setTaxFee()/setTreasury() are owner-only but lack a timelock or DAO governance, enabling sudden tax hikes (e.g., 100%) to trap users.

##Pausable Abuse:

The owner can pause transfers indefinitely, freezing funds. Consider adding a time-locked unpause or multi-sig.

##Treasury Privilege:

The treasury is exempt from taxes by default, allowing the owner to dump tax-free tokens (potential rug-pull vector).

##Precision Loss:

(amount * taxFee) / 100 rounds down, favoring users for small transfers. Use scaled math (e.g., 1e18 precision) for fairness.

##Centralization:

Single owner control is a red flag for scams. Use multi-sig or governance (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor).

#Critical Fixes Needed:

- Add a timelock for tax/treasury changes.

- Remove treasuryâ€™s default tax exemption (or document the risk).

- Consider community-controlled pauses (e.g., via DAO).

- Use SafeMath (though Solidity 0.8.x has built-in checks, explicit checks improve clarity).

Not a Scam Yet, But High Risk if Misused. Audit before deployment.
